# Lootbag

A basic exercise in Python unit testing. The instructions were as follows:

+ Unit test must be written before the actual code. 
+ Items can be added to bag, and assigned to a child.
+ Items can be removed from bag, per child. Removing ball from the bag should not be allowed. A child's name must be specified.
+ Must be able to list all children who are getting a toy.
+ Must be able to list all toys for a given child's name.
+ Must be able to set the delivered property of a child, which defaults to false to true.

The test file is lootbag.py and the code that was written on the basis of those tests are included in the bag.py file.
